(? Eriol ?)

(?
   What about Eriol feeling the *different* watcher, noticing that the watcher
   feels *wrong*, and *active*.
?)

*Bzzzzzzt.*

The noise woke me. Still drowsy, I failed to recognize its meaning and was
only spared a painful reminder by the belt keeping me stuck in bed as the ship
started maneuvering.

An attitude change? Again? The lass one had been only two days ago. Truth
be told, these accelerations were more of an annoyance than a danger,
provided the crew received notice early enough. In fact, back on the ship to
Supplicant Station, we had a policy of always ensuring nothing was left
unsecured whenever we were the last one to leave a room. Of course, good
manners dictated to always clean up after yourself regardless, but we checked
anyway, just to be safe. I had lost the habit during my time on the station and
received quite a painful remainder on that previous manouever.

Normally, I would not be too concerned about a ship needing to adjust its
course. That typically meant avoiding a hitherto undetected obstacle, or
correcting a trajectory that had deviated beyond the acceptable limits. But I
doubted anything so benine was at play here. Indeed, The previous maneuver had
been preceded by a wave of anxiety among the crew and, far from receiding, it
had grown deeper as time went on.

I knew where we were going. The ever strenghtening Watcher presence in my mind
made it clear. By now, I could tell *something* had changed. Still as
undecipherable, the Great Spirit in the Rings felt different from my days
aboard Supplicant Station. Part of it was subtle, which might be caused by
time. Although... The Eternal Watcher, aging? Hmm... But what confounded me
were the brief spikes it projected once a day. I assumed that matched the
moment the rings became parallel, whay 

The acceleration ceased, but I knew better than to unbuckle myself from the
bed. A change of orientation made very little difference in a ship's
trajectory. As large as this ship, no one was foolish enough to only
avoid obstacles by letting them pass in close proximity.

*Bzzzzzzt.* *Bzzzzzzt.* *Bzzzzzzt.*

Here it came, they were activating the main thrusters. That short but intense
force was where the real danger lay.  Considering its dilapidated interior,
I was not too reassured about the ship's structural integrity and, as a creaking
noise reverberated thorough the room, I regretted having left the station for
a brief moment. But then everything went back to the relative silence from
before. No sudden depressuration from a breach in the hull, no deflagration
from pipes having ruptured. No, just the squeaking of vents forming the
unending background noise.

I detached myself from the bed and went straight for my food reserves. This
was the fifth day since our departure from the station, and by now I had
managed to find everything I needed to survive. The crew was still unaware of
my presence. Maybe they would have noticed, had they checked their cameras. Or
maybe the cameras that took me by surprise had not been powered on. Or just
plain broken, given the state of everything around here.

I spent my days trying to heal the egregore and exploring the ship. My
protege's recovery was very slow, hampered by the lack of hunvre, but while it
still remained unresponsive as of yet, I deemed a full recovery plausible,
given enough time. My excursions had revealed a vessel considerably larger
than its crew of six implied. My findings from yesterday included a guide for
newcomers aboard the ship. Quite convenient, and not something I had expected
to find, but the reason for its existence quickly became obvious. The ship I
was stowing away aboard of, the "Konogan Salvation", turned out to be a
rescue ship subcontracted by a company called "Sacrovir Insurance".

The idea of having people roamming space in order to save the lives of those
in danger definitely had its charms, and I initially mistook it for a form of
heroism, but as I should have expected, the pages that followed described a
grimer reality. Not as selfless selfless an occupation as it first seemed, for
if one did not have an active subscription to Sacrovir Insurance's services,
accepting to be rescued would automatically make them incur a considerable
debt. Unconscious people were assumed to conscent to those terms, out of
necessity. It even mentioned payment alternatives, not expecting those who had
just survived a shipwreck to be able to afford spending large sums. I was glad
to notice organ extraction did not belong to that list, as it was mostly
composed of different forms of indentured servitude to other branches of the
Sacrovir conglomerate. Perhaps it was as simple as Sacrovir not having a
subsidiary in that particular field. My limited experience with this new
reality made a pessimist out of me, and I was saddened at the realization.

I reminded myself that in all situations, and especially the dire ones, the
Watcher's Chosens were supposed to be the example, the guides to follow, and
those to seek for refuge. Never before had I been faced with an ordeal of this
magnitude, and I knew myself to be failing in my duties. Even faced with the
sudden disparition of our world, the path forward had been clear. Keep faith
in the Watcher, keep hope even when all others had given up. But I had some
pillar to hold on to,

Maybe I could simply reveal myself to the crew and accept to take on such a
contract, but I would rather ascertain our destination before doing so. Then
again, perhaps I was just inventing excuses to delay the inevitable.

It was not like the crew would run out of supplies. According to the guide,
the ship could host nearly hundred people, and though my exploration had
revealed most of the chambers to be neither heated nor pressured, water and
food rations were kept accessible and stocked. Enough so for at least a few
weeks at full capacity. As expected, Neutrapaste made the bulk of it. Its
food's taste, or lack thereof, was making every meal increasingly unpleasant. No
wonder the crew never came to get any.

The crew... I concentrated on them, and found that their anxiety had evolved
into fear. Something was clearly going on, but I had no idea what. Maybe I
could find out. It would be risky, but I ought to be able to get close enough
to hear what they were saying without being caught. And if they did catch me,
well, that just meant I would have to request rescue according to the terms of
their service.

Three of them were currently grouped together, which gave me the opportunity
to spy on their conversation. The only member of the crew I had met so far,
Thurian, was not among those three.

I went to their part of the ship, being careful to remember the way back.
Direction signs were sparse, probably for the same monetary reasons as the
bare-bone nature of this ship. Comfort and aesthetics were clearly not
priorities here, to the point where safety suffered from it. No foamy pads to
absorb shocks. The tubes and wires spread on the walls looked to me like fire
hazards. What if a claw caught into a live one? I progressed methodically,
making sure anything I used to propel myself was tightly attached and not at a
dangerous temperature.

I neared the place where they were gathered. Unfortunately, this meant I had
to go past the other three. I risked finding myself cornered should they wander
around. They had not moved during the time it had taken me to come here, so I
judged it somewhat safe.

My translator picked up the group's conversation, conveying it with my voice.
I was glad they were using their own translators, because the one crew member
not of Thurian's species was absent and they miht have opted to talk without.
As I started listening in, I noticed the device actually did more work than I
had given it credit for, slightly shifting the pitch of my voice depending on
who spoke.

I dared not peek into the room, nor even stand right next to the door.
Instead, I set myself in the neighboring room, which was close enough for
everything to be heard.

"...Thurian's fault! Why did you have to send *him*?"

Someone was upset about Thurian. Missing the start of that conversation, I
tried to think about why that could be. I had met him as he went back to the
ship with a cargo of food. Having completed that transport myself, I knew that
on this point, Thurian had not failed. He had also mentioned a lockdown and
having somehow gotten security to let this ship leave. The only vessel allowed
to do so, according to him. Another thing that Thurian should be thanked for,
not blamed, unless...

"Well, because we were stuck there! I thought it might help. I don't think
anyone else could have managed it. And it worked!"

Another person talking, but that confirmed it. This was about Thurian and
whatever he did to convince security. *What* had he done, exactly?

"Yeah, it did. The captain made the right call. You know Thurian;
complications were expected."

And the third crewmate, now. That told me who the captain was, but what did
they mean  about complications? Did Thurian get his authorization through force?
Or through coertion of some kind?

"But pirates?! At least on the station we were safe!"

Pirates? What? How could Thurian getting security to let the ship go result in
a pirate attack? That made no sense to me. But that fit the anxiety and fear
the crew was feeling. Just how much danger were we in?

"Come on, it's not *that* bad. They won't touch us or the ship. They want
cargo."

What cargo? As far as I knew, food and water were the only thing being carried.
The one plan of the ship I had seen indicated there was very little room for
anything else. This vessel was meant to transport people.

"It could be a bunch of slavers! Why would they target a rescue ship if they
just want cargo?"

Ah, so it was not just me. But regardless of the reason, it seemed pirates
were attacking. What could I do?

"Thurian probably ran his mouth. That's what he does, isn't it?"

"We are *not* putting the blame on Thurian," the captain said. "*I* sent him,
so I'm the one taking the blame, if anyone is. Anyway, we still have three
hours until they get here. Visant, have you ever dealt with that situation
before? What do you suggest we do?"

"Never on a defenseless ship. Yeah, I know, I know, can't have weapons
installed on a rescue ship. But no, I don't see any alternatives here... we'll
have to do exactly what they said and not initiate any communications."

"But what if they're slavers! Shouldn't we hide?"

"We can't all hide, Yeuna. But you're right, we need to take some precautions
against kidnapping. And it's best if they don't see Sorcha or Alienor."

"What?! I'm the captain, I can't hide while our ship's under attack!"

"You're the only one on board they could realistically try to ransom. It would
be dumb on their part, but they're pirates, so... let's not risk it. Problem
is, They might have a manifest of the ship. What do we say if they ask where
you are, Alienor?"

"I don't know!"

"We left her at the station?"

"Hah! No way they'd believe that."

"What, then?"

"I don't know, but I guess you've got three hours to figure it out. In the
meantime, Sorcha and I should hide Luan's supply."

"Right. Okay, I'll get the rest of the crew. We'll figure something out.
Somehow."

Visant left the room and passed the one I was hiding in without even a glance.

Pirates. Not something I had ever had to worry about. What could I even do?
Hide, as they told the captain to do? I would not be on any ship manifest, of
course, but if they were slavers as Yeuna feared, where would that leave me? If
they took the crew and I found myself alone on this ship, I doubted I would
manage to pilot it. And that was assuming the pirates were not simply going to
destroy the ship to hide their actions. I supposed the captain and Sorcha faced a
similar dilemma. Perhaps having an extra person onboard could help them. But
if Yeuna was right, and the pirates were just interested in cargo, then what?
If the matter was as simple as it seemed, then there was no reason to risk an
actual encounter. They would have simply jetissoned the goods and left the
pirates recover them. Would the pirates shoot down the ship then, not having
any reason not to? That seemed needlessly cruel, but I had not been given the
most encouraging view of society had evolved during my cryosleep. Or perhaps
it was because the pirates would search the ship to make sure no bounty has
been kept from them. That could make hiding considerably harder, depending on
how many pirates were involved.

Yes, hiding was the best option. But I knew the captain and Sorcha were not able
to find me, so they would likewise be unable to track any search party. And if
they thought they could remain hidden from the pirates, then they expected
those pirates to be just as unable to find them. Empaths were rare, it seemed.
That had very worrysome implications about the current state of the Watcher's
Order, but I could inquire about them later.

Making sure to remain hidden for now, I went back to the part of the ship no
one else used. While I did manage to get there unnoticed, my senses informed me
Visant and someone who I assumed to be Sorcha were headed in my direction.
Sorcha was the one crewmate not of Thurian's species, making their mood
unreadable. I had retrieved the most important treasure I owned from the room
I slept in, the booklet with plans of the ship. Avoiding detection from people
not actively looking for me was trivial, but I would need to be considerably
more careful with pirates onboard, so having an idea of where I was going
could prove valuable.

I shadowed the pair as they headed for the food supply, getting my first
glance at Sorcha. She, I assumed from the name, had a chitin exoskeleton, with
a lime sort of green as its main color despite its blue iridescence. A maze of
thin white lines covered her entire body, and I could not tell whether these
were decorative motifs, or the traces of injuries sustained. If the latter,
then Sorcha had to have gone through quite the ordeals. I doubted a single
event could have caused all of this without killing her outright. She had
large compound eyes, displaying cyan and emerald patterns around a darker
center. That was dangerous. I had no idea what the range of her sight might
be.

Sorcha was busy working on a door I was familiar with, as I had struggled to
figure out its mechanisms when foraging for supplies. Her large claws made it
look like she was about to simply tear the sealing wheel appart, but it turned
without suffering any visible damage.

Once the door was opened, Sorcha looked inside and I sensed a strong emotion
from her, although it was too alien for me to interpret. Her antennae shifted,
confirming it.

I could not see her mouth, but I had no issue recognizing who spoke then.
"Visant, did anyone express discontentment at Louan's food?"

Visant had been lost in thoughts and jolted at Sorcha's seemingly unexpected
question. "I don't think Louan's ever failed a meal since I was onboard. Why
do you ask?"

"The Neutrapaste packages are not stored properly."

"What?" Visant went to have a look. "I don't see it. Seems secure to me. Are
you sure?"

"Yes. It is *quite* unsightly. The pattern is broken. It's... upsetting."

"Huh... If you say so. I'll ask the others later. We have more urgent things
to deal with."

"No. I must repair this. I will give you Louan's poisons as I work."

"Can't you--no, nevermind, I know better than to even ask." Visant sighed. "Go
ahead, please."

Sorcha went into the room and, in a surprisingly short amount of time,
packages started floating out. After about twenty boxes, the flow stopped.

"These are all our reserves of poison for this storage bay," Sochra said.
"Please do not inform me of where you put them."

Visant was regrouping all the packages into a group, making sure they would
not disperse. He stopped to look at Sorcha. "Uh... Are you making a joke about
the displaced food?"

"No. I do not want to know about extremely dangerous products being stashed
unharmoniously."

Visant said nothing for a moment, perhaps trying to decide whether this might
be another joke, or whether both statements had been genuine.

"Fair enough," he finally declared. "No suggestions, then?"

"Avoid anything related to the ventilation or water system."

"Hmm..."

"Those containers are not rated for use outside the ship."

"Right, but-"

"I will not store poison in my room."

"Damn."

It seemed they were going to be busy there for a while, so I went to explore
some more, to make sure the map I had was accurate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I should have expected it, but I still found myself confused by the presence
of passages not shown on the plans I had of the ship. Maintainance tunnels,
large enough for me to  go through quite confortably. Some had doors which
were obviously supposed to be locked, but none were. I had nothing to write
with, nor the time to go spelunking, so I resigned myself to be limited to the
main pathways for any fast paced escape.

As they had discussed, Alienor went into hidding and kept exhuding apprehensive
impatience and frustration, both growing as time went on. She was close by,
though I had not dared get any closer to her, in case she chanced to see me
first and I got into trouble just before the pirates came aboard. No, I would
help her if I could, but I had better wait for the situation to call for it,
instead of taking pointless risks.

Sorcha had returned to join the rest of the crew, though she then went to
wherever she spent most of her time. I did not understand how that counted as
hiding, but I assumed she had her reasons. The others were patiently waiting,
all in close proximity to each other.

As I tried to figure out the best paths to move from one part of the ship to
another, I realized what the almost unnoticeable sensation I had started to
feel over the last handful of minutes meant. This was not a phenomenon I had
ever encountered before, but I supposed it made sense. On a planet, one
quickly learned to ignore the torrent of melded emotions flowing from all
directions. Unless I focused, the feelings conflicted too much to really
impact me, but it also took its toll. An imperfect white noise, with spots of
colors exploding then being quickly drowned away. The vastness of space,
combined with the extremely low density of population onboard ships and
stations, made this a non-issue. The sensations remained distinct, although
alien minds appeared to rarely be within my capacity to interpret. But what I
was feeling now had not happened before, because there never had been the
possibility for a different ship to rendez-vous with us.

Still faint for now, but undeniable. People were closing in on us. There was
nothing to do but wait for the inevitable.
